# Gantner.jl

Read the data from Gantner files. This file is based on the read-exact.mex functionality, and used the Gantner giutility.dll shared library for its functionality.

This file can be extended with the remaining functionality within read-exact.mex, but reviewing the read_exact.c file and adding the appropriated calls to giutility.
